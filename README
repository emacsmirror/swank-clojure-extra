* swank-clojure-extra

swank-clojure-extra provides some extra utilities for using slime [1] with
swank-clojure [2]. The extras provided by this package includes

 - swank-clojure-project: a way to open swank-clojure on a specific
   project. This is very useful as java does not provide a way to
   modify classpath at runtime.
 - manual configuration of swank/slime.
 - more to come..

This project is an offshoot of swank-clojure and was created as an attempt
to separate emacs specific utilities which got added over a period of time
into swank-clojure.el into a separate project. 

* Usage

In your ~/.emacs file, add the swank-clojure-extra into your load-path
and load it.

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/swank-clojure-extra")
(require 'swank-clojure-extra)

** Customization

swank-clojure-extra provides the a few variables which can be customized
from your emacs configuration files.
